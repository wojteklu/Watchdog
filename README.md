Class for logging excessive blocking on the main thread. It watches the main thread and checks if it doesnâ€™t get blocked for more than defined threshold. You can also inspect which part of your code is blocking the main thread.

</p>

```
ðŸ‘® Main thread was blocked for 1.25s ðŸ‘®
```

## Usage

Simply, just instantiate Watchdog with number of seconds that must pass to consider the main thread blocked. Additionally you can enable `strictMode` that stops the execution whenever the threshold is reached. This way, you can inspect which part of your code is blocking the main thread.

```Swift
let watchdog = Watchdog(threshold: 0.4, strictMode: true)
```

Don't forget to retain Watchdog somewhere or it will get released when it goes out of scope.
